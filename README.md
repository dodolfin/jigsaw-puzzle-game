A simple jigsaw puzzle game I made as a school ICT project in 2019.

# Launching

The only requirements are python3 and `pygame`. Create a virtual environment and install it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
(Windows) venv\Scripts\activate.bat
(UNIX) venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# About game

Unfortunately, the game is only available in Russian language. I haven't thought about localization.

The game has a simple click sound which plays when another piece of puzzle is placed correctly. This can be disabled in the settings.

The “excursion” mode was made to link this game with another part of my school project which was [a website about Picasso art](http://q90612fo.bget.ru/picasso/).
